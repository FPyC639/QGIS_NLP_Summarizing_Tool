# QGIS_NLP_Summarizing_Tool

This project involves developing a tool that will display an interactive map on an HTML-based website. By incorporating a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm, the tool will overlay a data layer containing concise summaries about production models from various manufacturing plants. It will offer valuable insights into supply chain issues stemming from manufacturing problems, allowing users to identify and address batch errors. As a result, the tool is expected to contribute to a significant improvement in customer service levels.
